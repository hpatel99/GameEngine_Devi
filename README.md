# GameEngine_Devi
Pet Project to explore wilds of Game Engine.Using OpenGL.
Contact me on harsh.nocturnalking@gmail.com 

Using FBX SDK to convert fbx files to Custom formats.
Aim is to read only the bit of information needed from FBX and use that to make animationa dn skinning possible in engine.It is more Data driven.
Unless you know What i am writing to the file and reading back those files will make no sense to you.

NO STL (Weird, i know but.......   Well no explanation for this.)
